    You should be aware that there are certain things that
    Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd. will not take responsibility for.
    Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
    active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
    provided by your mobile network provider, but
    Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd. cannot take responsibility for the
    app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
    access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
    allowance left.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
    should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
    may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
    for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,
    or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
    accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
    roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
    territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
    roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
    which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
    that you have received permission from the bill payer for
    using the app.
</p>
<p>
    Along the same lines, Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd. cannot always
    take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
    need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
    runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
    Service, Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd. cannot accept
    responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd.’s responsibility for
    your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
    important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
    ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
    rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
    we can make it available to you.
    Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd. accepts no liability for any loss,
    direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
    wholly on this functionality of the app.
</p>
<p>
    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
    currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
    both systems (and for any additional systems we
    decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
    and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
    using the app. Hung Hon Industrial Co. Ltd. does not promise that
    it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
    and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
    accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
    may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
    use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
    to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
    (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
    will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
    delete it from your device.
